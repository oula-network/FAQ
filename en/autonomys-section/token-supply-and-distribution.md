# ðŸ’° Autonomys Network Token Supply & Distribution

{% embed url="https://oula.network/en/" %}

The [Subspace Foundation](http://subspace.foundation/), [headquartered](https://www.zefix.ch/en/search/entity/list/firm/1595643) in Zug, Switzerland, has deployed the [Autonomys Network](http://autonomys.xyz/)â€”an implementation of the cutting-edge [Subspace Protocol](https://autonomys.xyz/solution). This paper outlines the supply, allocation and distribution of the Autonomys Networkâ€™s native $AI3 token.

## $AI3 Supply & Allocation

The total fixed supply of Autonomys' native token $AI3 is 1,000,000,000. This supply will be allocated across the categories listed below, with further details provided in the sections that follow.

65% of the supply (650,000,000 $AI3) was minted at [Mainnet Phase-1](https://medium.com/subspace-network/the-phases-of-mainnet-3a08d7aa7178) with the launch of the consensus chain. Token transferability is disabled at the protocol level until the Token Generation Event (TGE), which will be marked by the launch of Mainnet Phase-2. While testnet rewards are not subject to a lockup period, tokens allocated to stakeholders are subject to strict vesting schedules.

The remaining 35% (350,000,000 $AI3) will be minted as block rewards over an approximately 40-year period. This structure ensures controlled circulation while maintaining long-term ecosystem sustainability through the [gradual issuance of farming rewards](https://medium.com/subspace-network/from-space-race-to-long-tail-crafting-a-sustainable-token-issuance-model-for-a-resilient-b2adc15dbf67) (see _Farmer Rewards_ section below).

## $AI3 Distribution

### Investors (21.53%)

Investor tokens are released according to a 48-month lockup schedule, with a 12-month cliff starting at Mainnet Phase-2, and monthly releases thereafter. At the end of the 12-month cliff, 25% of the tokens are unlocked. The remaining 75% are released linearly over the subsequent 36 months, at a rate of 1/36th per month from months 13 through 48.

### Team (9.49%)

Team tokens are released according to a 48-month lockup schedule, with a 12-month cliff, and monthly releases thereafter. At the end of the 12-month cliff, 25% of the tokens are unlocked. The remaining 75% are released linearly over the subsequent 36 months, at a rate of 1/36th per month from months 13 through 48.

* Founders (2.00%)
* Advisors (2.35%)
* Staff (5.14%)

### Autonomys Labs (9.00%)

* DevCo Treasury (7.00%)
  * The majority of the DevCo tokens are released according to a 48-month lockup schedule, with a 12-month cliff, and monthly releases thereafter. At the end of the 12-month cliff, 25% of the tokens are unlocked. The remaining 75% are released linearly over the subsequent 36 months, at a rate of 1/36th per month from months 13 through 48.
* Market Liquidity (2.00%)
  * A portion of the DevCo tokens will be unlocked at TGE for liquidity provisioning and operating activities, including market making and exchanges.

### Partners (1.43%)

Partner tokensâ€”paid as remuneration for vendor servicesâ€”are released according to a 48-month lockup schedule, with a 12-month cliff, and monthly releases thereafter. At the end of the 12-month cliff, 25% of the tokens are unlocked. The remaining 75% are released linearly over the subsequent 36 months, at a rate of 1/36th per month from months 13 through 48.

### Community (58.55%)

#### Subspace Foundation (15.68%)

* Operations (0.68%): Liquid for Subspace Foundation operating expenses.
* Near-Term Treasury (5.00%): Lockups TBD as tokens are deployed for ecosystem bootstrapping.
* Long-Term Treasury (10.00%): 4-year lockup with a 1-year cliff for community provisions, grants, and ecosystem development.

The token release schedule for the Subspace Foundationâ€™s Long-Term Treasury follows a 48-month lockup schedule, with a 12-month cliff, and monthly releases thereafter. At the end of the 12-month cliff, 25% of the tokens are unlocked. The remaining 75% are released linearly over the subsequent 36 months, at a rate of 1/36th per month from months 13 through 48.

#### Ambassadors (1.00%)

The vesting schedule for [ambassadors](https://www.autonomys.xyz/ambassadors) varies according to their start date and position.

The Subspace Foundation partnered with [BlockScience](http://block.science/) to develop a [novel dynamic issuance model](https://medium.com/subspace-network/from-space-race-to-long-tail-crafting-a-sustainable-token-issuance-model-for-a-resilient-b2adc15dbf67) that will mint farmer rewards over the duration of the blockchainâ€™s 40-year lifecycle.
