# ü§ñ Aleo Mining Tutorial - Pool

{% embed url="https://oula.network/en" %}

> &#x20;‚ùï [ALEO](https://www.aleo.org/) is a blockchain project that integrates Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus mechanisms to offer highly private smart contract capabilities. It utilizes advanced Synthesis Puzzle technology to ensure transaction privacy and security. Aleo focuses on developing decentralized applications and provides efficient and secure privacy protection solutions.

Please read the mining tutorial carefully and follow the steps to connect the mining machine to the mining pool.

### **Environment Setup**

* **Operating Systems**: <mark style="color:red;">**Ubuntu 22.04 (GCC 11.4)**</mark>
* **GPU CUDA Version: **<mark style="color:red;">**12.3**</mark>
* **NVIDIA Driver Version: **<mark style="color:red;">**545 or higher**</mark>
* **Software Clients**: [**oula-pool-prover (fe7726a-2024-08-19-1)**](https://github.com/oula-network/aleo/releases)

{% hint style="info" %}
Please stay updated with [<mark style="color:blue;">**OULA's official website**</mark>](https://oula.network/en) announcements and use the latest version of the software client for optimal technical service and higher Token output.
{% endhint %}

### **Account Setup**

* Register for an [**Oula Account**](https://oula.network/en/register) and setup the [**Sub-Account**](https://oula.network/en/pool/manager?tab=subAccount).
* Use the default Aleo Sub-Account name or the created one to start the mining software.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
After running the software client, daily output will be automatically accumulated to the corresponding sub-account. Once the balance reaches the minimum payout threshold, the platform will automatically pay out to the bound withdrawal address daily.
{% endhint %}

### **Program Execution**

#### **Oula Pool Prover**

* Download the [**oula-pool-prover**](https://github.com/oula-network/aleo/releases) on Ubuntu systems.
* Grant permission with the command:

```sh
chmod +x oula-pool-prover
```

* Set execution permission with the command:

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```bash
nohup ./oula-pool-prover --pool wss://aleo.oula.network:6666 --account account --worker-name worker_name > prover.log 2>&1 &
```
{% endcode %}

* [ ] Replace the pool address (`--pool`) with the "Mining Address" provided on the [**Overview**](https://oula.network/en/pool/manager) page.
* [ ] Replace the account (`--account`) with the "Account Name" created on the [**Sub-Account**](https://oula.network/en/pool/manager?tab=subAccount) page.
* [ ] Replace the worker name (`--worker-name`) .

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Sub-account and miner names can be customized but must be globally unique!**&#x20;

**It is recommended to use 2-15 lowercase letters, numbers, or a combination, and the name cannot start with a number.**
{% endhint %}

* Check logs with the command:

```bash
tail -f prover.log
```

{% hint style="success" %}
If you see relevant success messages in <mark style="color:red;">`prover.log`</mark>, the program has started successfully.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
**If you do not need to output log content, you can replace '&> prover.log &' in the startup command with '> /dev/null 2>&1 &'.**
{% endhint %}

* To stop the program, use:

```bash
killall aleo-pool-prover
# Force stop
```

### **Monitoring and Yield Viewing**

Once your mining machine is running stably and submitting solutions, you can check the worker's operational status, output details and payment details under [**Worker**](https://oula.network/en/pool/manager?tab=miner) and [**Output / Payout**](https://oula.network/en/pool/manager?tab=output) by switching to the corresponding sub-account.
