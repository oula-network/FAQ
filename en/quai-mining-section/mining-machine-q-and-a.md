# üñ•Ô∏è Mining Machine Q\&A

{% embed url="https://oula.network/en/" %}

#### Q: What is the minimum configuration requirement for mining machines?

**A:** The minimum configuration requirement is **a 2-core CPU** and **4GB of memory**.

***

#### Q: What operating systems are currently supported by the Oula mining pool?

**A:** Currently, the Oula mining pool only supports **Linux** and **Ubuntu-based HiveOS**, requiring **NVIDIA GPUs**.

***

#### Q: What is the difference between local hashrate and effective hashrate, and why are there two types?

**A:**

* **Local Hashrate**: Refers to the actual computational power of the mining machine at the local level.
* **Effective Hashrate**: Refers to the computational power that meets the requirements of the blockchain network.

Mining pools typically assign tasks with lower difficulty levels, which lower-powered machines can complete. However, this may not meet the difficulty requirements of the blockchain network, resulting in a difference between local hashrate and effective hashrate.
