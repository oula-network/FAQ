# üñ•Ô∏è Mining Machine Q\&A

{% embed url="https://oula.network/en/" %}

#### **Q: Is this GPU or hardware (storage)-based mining?**

**A:** Mining requires at least a **GPU/CPU** combined with **hardware storage**.

***

**Q: What is the difference in efficiency between using CPU and GPU for plotting?**

**A:** Both **CPU** and **GPU** can be used for plotting, but in terms of efficiency, **GPU** is significantly more efficient. Using a GPU will allow farmers to complete the plotting process faster, reducing resource consumption and improving overall performance.

***

#### **Q: What storage devices should be used for mining?**

**A:** For mining, **SSD** (Solid-State Drive) is required, as it supports high-speed random read/write operations. **HDD** (Hard Disk Drive) is not suitable for mining, as it can only handle a limited amount of data‚Äîapproximately 200GB per disk‚Äîmaking it inefficient for large-scale mining operations. Therefore, **HDDs cannot participate** effectively in the mining process.

***

**Q: What are the current bandwidth requirements?**\
**A:** Storage servers need at least **20 Gbps** of bandwidth, and each node requires a minimum of **200 Mbps** of bandwidth.

***

**Q: Which series of graphics cards are supported? Does it support AI cards and enterprise-level Nvidia graphics cards?**\
**A:** Oula's mining software theoretically supports **Nvidia 2080 series and above** for mining. The performance of **Nvidia AI cards** and **enterprise-level graphics cards** should be verified based on actual conditions.

***

**Q: What is the minimum hardware configuration required for mining?**\
**A:** Please refer to the [mining tutorial](../mining-tutorial/autonomys-linux/#recommended-software-and-hardware-configuration) for the recommended hardware configuration.

***

**Q: Which operating systems are supported for running the mining software? Does it support mining in WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)?**\
**A:** Currently, Oula's mining software only supports **Linux systems**.

***

**Q: Is a VPN required? How should DNS be configured?**\
**A:** A VPN is **not required**.
