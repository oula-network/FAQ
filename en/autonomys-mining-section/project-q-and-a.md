# üîç Project Q\&A

{% embed url="https://oula.network/en/" %}

**Q: What is the conversion rate between tSSC and AI3?**\
**A:** The official token economics will be made public on November 13, 2024. Due to different incentive stages with various reward pools and mechanisms, there is no unified conversion rate from tSSC to AI3. Please refer to the [README](https://github.com/subspace/incentivized-testnets) file for the specific calculation method.

***

**Q: Which wallet should be used for Autonomys?**\
**A:** It is recommended to use the [**Subwallet**](https://www.subwallet.app/). For a detailed setup guide, please refer to the [Subwallet Installation Guide](https://docs.autonomys.xyz/wallets/subwallet/).

***

**Q: What is the maximum supply of AI3?**\
**A:** The maximum supply of AI3 on the mainnet is **1 billion tokens**.

***

**Q: What are the user considerations for the Autonomys project?**\
**A:** Below are several important points that users should pay attention to regarding the Autonomys project:

**Q: What are the key stages and timelines for the Autonomys mainnet?**

**A:**

<mark style="color:yellow;">**Phase 1: Launchpad (6 Nov)**</mark>

* The Subspace Foundation will launch the network and infrastructure with a launch event featuring a **Proof-of-Time (PoT)** seed ceremony.
* Genesis Data seeding will commence, enabling farmers to join the network, plot, and sync their nodes according to instructions shared with the community.
* **Important:** Data synchronization will take place during this phase, and farmers should prepare for this process before starting to plot.

<mark style="color:yellow;">**Phase 2: Lift-off (13 Nov)**</mark>

* The **Space Race** officially begins once the data seeding process is complete, the initial solution range is set, and the target amount of pledged storage is announced via a community event.
* Farmers will then be able to start producing blocks (farming). Farmers who plot the first sectors on the mainnet will be eligible for the highest rewards according to the issuance curve once the farming process is enabled.

***

**Q: Is there any time window allocated for network preparation and plotting?**

**A:** Yes, after the mainnet is launched, the project will reserve time for the entire network to prepare data and begin plotting. This means that farmers cannot start mining immediately but must wait until the official farming start date announced during the online meeting (13 Nov).

***

#### **Q: How is the re-plotting mechanism implemented?**

**A:** All data plotted on hard drives is time-sensitive. This means that after a period of time, the plotted data will need to be **re-plotted** to maintain its validity. The re-plotting process ensures that farmers continue to store new user-uploaded data and maintain data shard balance.

***

#### **Q: What are the stages between mainnet release and token trading?**

**A:** There are several stages between the launch of the mainnet and the ability to trade tokens:

1. **Mainnet Online** ‚Äì The network is launched and the foundation prepares for the upcoming data seeding and plotting stages.
2. **Prepare Data & Plotting** ‚Äì Farmers begin plotting and syncing data as per the instructions.
3. **Official Mining Starts** ‚Äì After a period of preparation, the official farming/mining process begins and blocks are produced.
4. **Token Trading** ‚Äì After a certain period, tokens can be traded. Note that since the mainnet is split into two phases, **tokens can only be transferred during phase 2** of the mainnet.

***

**A:** These steps and stages outline the key milestones for participating in the Autonomys network. Ensure you stay updated with the latest announcements and timelines from the community to maximize your participation.

***

**Q: What does "expired data" mean?**\
**A:** "Expired data" refers to data that needs to be re-plotted periodically in order to store new user-uploaded data and balance the data shards.

***

**Q: What is the logic for calculating mining power? What unit is used?**\
**A:** Mining power is directly correlated with the storage size, so the unit for mining power is **MiB**.

***

**Q: How can I query on-chain data from the official explorer?**\
**A:** On-chain data can be queried through the official explorer: [Astral - Autonomys Explorer](https://astral.autonomys.xyz/).

***

**Q:** **How to understand "Total Network Theoretical Power" and "Total Network Effective Power"?**

**A:**

* **Total Network Theoretical Power**: Refers to the theoretical total power, which is the sum of block production power and loss power. Loss power is typically caused by issues like forks, disk failures, or delays in proof computation that lead to block loss.
* **Total Network Effective Power**: Refers to the effective power that generates revenue. It is calculated based on difficulty, which is determined by block production speed and directly impacts earnings.
