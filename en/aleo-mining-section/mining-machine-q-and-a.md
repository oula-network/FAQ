# üñ•Ô∏è Mining Machine Q\&A

{% embed url="https://oula.network/en/" %}

**Q: Does Oula offer Aleo hosting service?**

A: Kindly contact Oula[ Telegram community admins](https://t.me/oulacommunity) for more information or email us at <mark style="color:blue;">contacts@oula.network.</mark>



**Q: What specific requirements are needed for Aleo mining?**

A: When using GPU mining, there are no restrictions on the CPU or RAM of the mining machine. Multiple GPUs can be installed on a single machine.



**Q: How many GPUs can a single device support for mining?**

A: As long as there is sufficient power supply, the number of GPUs on a single device is unlimited.



**Q: Which operating systems does Aleo mining support?**

A: Currently, we support Ubuntu 22.04. For Ubuntu 20.04, the default GCC version is 9.4 and needs to be upgraded to GCC 11.4. HiveOS is also supported, please refer to the [mining tutorial documentation](../start-mining/publish-your-docs-2.md) for specific instructions.



**Q: Should I choose the Desk or Server version of the operating system ISO?**\
A: The Desk version defaults to using GPU memory, so we strongly recommend using the Server version.



**Q: Are AMD GPUs supported?**\
A: Currently, AMD GPUs are not supported.



**Q: Is Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) supported?**\
A: No, it is not supported.



**Q: Do I need a VPN to connect to the mining pool?**

A: A VPN may be needed if you encounter network issues. If everything runs smoothly, a VPN is not required.
