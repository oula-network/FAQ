# üîç Project Q\&A

{% embed url="https://oula.network/en/" %}

#### Q: In Aleo mining, the log shows that I mined a block. Why don‚Äôt I receive block rewards?

A: When connected to a mining pool, you are using the proof target set by the pool, which is usually much lower than the on-chain proof target. Therefore, even if the log shows that a solution was found, it does not necessarily mean the block was successfully mined on-chain.

***

#### Q: What could cause a decrease in earnings?

A: Apart from issues with the user's mining rig, the primary reason is the increase in blockchain difficulty. This growth in difficulty on the chain is the main factor.

***

#### Q: Why is there a significant difference between actual mining earnings and theoretical earnings?

A: When blockchain difficulty fluctuates greatly, actual earnings may differ significantly from theoretical earnings. This is normal, as network-wide rewards also vary accordingly.

A: You can obtain the wallet address through Leo Wallet, which is universal.&#x20;
